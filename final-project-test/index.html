Located in the middle of Idaho, the Salmon River, also known as "The river of No Return", flows from Galena Summit in the Boulder Mountains for approximately 425 miles to meet with the Snake River, which flows into the Columbia River. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean, where sockeye salmon start their spawning cycle each year.

Riggins is one of the towns located along the seasonally salmon-filled waters of the Salmon River. You can imagine how it was named, but that's not why we exist...

Whitewater! That is why we exist! Feel the rush, the spray, the excitement when you run the Salmon!
