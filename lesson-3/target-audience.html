            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
            The target audience for this website is any human of age from 5 to 105 who needs to know current and/or future weather conditions to help plan their school, work or play day, or their visit or vacation, or just driving conditions if they are passing through. 
       <br> 
       <br>
             It will also be very useful for local businesses who sell any products related to the weather, for example, if they sell umbrellas and it will rain in the next week or so, they may want to do a promotion on their umbrellas. Other non-local companies may want to do targeted marketing to certain local areas that will be having severe weather conditions also. 
             <br> 
             <br>
            Users will probably be checking their phones for the weather reports, so it will be important to have a responsive website. The information will need to be available 24 hours a day and updated regularly for those who will be checking often.

              <br>
                She needs a way to get the weather prediction so she knows if she can ride her bike to the library on Saturday with her friends. 
                Mom does allow her to use her cell phone to look things up quickly.

                Wants to celebrate with his son, who will be graduating soon and will then leave for a job in Germany. The trip he is planning is on the other side of the country, so local news won't help that much.
