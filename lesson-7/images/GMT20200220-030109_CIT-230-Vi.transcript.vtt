1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:14.280
Jason Blazzard: Alright, I think we're good to go. Let's welcome everyone to see it soon to be W DD 234 Week seven. So in week seven we finally add another page to our weather site.

2
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.440
Jason Blazzard: This page will be a gallery page and what its intent is is for development specifications, you may or may not have this type of thing on a website, but it's a

3
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:36.420
Jason Blazzard: It's a gallery of pictures that you know different people have sent in for the region of Preston Idaho sugar city and whatever. The third one is

4
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.550
Jason Blazzard: And for this region. These pictures are put in there. You know, people are like to be photographers and they do a good job and

5
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.940
Jason Blazzard: It won't really matter what pictures you select to use, but you're going to create this page that's a gallery page.

6
00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.300
Jason Blazzard: And I'll talk about that towards the end here, but we want to prep for it by first understanding. You know what we're doing with images still

7
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:20.250
Jason Blazzard: And obviously you are responsible to make sure that you optimize your images at a basic level, there won't be a lot of dictation to you about exactly using Source set or other certain methods because obviously we've presented a few things to you.

8
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:32.040
Jason Blazzard: But unless it specifies it in the instructions or requirements on a particular assignment. You're not really obligated to use one thing or the other.

9
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
Jason Blazzard: You are obligated to meet the 230 standards so that checklist.

10
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.580
Jason Blazzard: Now for me, I am not going through and grading all those this week, a few of you have my class have already received your video feedback. And you know what I was looking for.

11
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.610
Jason Blazzard: Really, I was focusing this last week on week six on the things that we added, but these, all these things are, you're responsible for

12
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.360
Jason Blazzard: Especially as you get to the end on week 11 where we have all the pages put together and the site done and it's worth a little bit more points because

13
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:19.680
Jason Blazzard: We expected you to go through the feedback over time and make corrections and updates and clarifications as needed, because you could reach out to your instructor. If there's something that's confusing to you about that.

14
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.640
Jason Blazzard: So we add another page now.

15
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:40.170
Jason Blazzard: There is no requirement. This week for you to update Preston seven specifically. But, like I just said, that would be a wise thing to do to kind of make corrections over time. So you're not bogged down in week 11 as you finish it up.

16
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so let's look at just an overview of Week seven

17
00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:01.140
Jason Blazzard: We talked about CSS grid review. So this is just an activity. There's no assignment associated with it, where we want you to see through a good source some more information about grid.

18
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:14.130
Jason Blazzard: In case you want to use grid further, you might as well get it down. Right. And so hopefully you learn some principles for going through that required reading in quotes.

19
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:30.120
Jason Blazzard: Now this other activity. You do have to submit. It's worth 10 points and you'll create a link to it as well as to your gallery page for this next week's on your assignment portal, you'll create links to both of these

20
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:42.750
Jason Blazzard: So let's take a look at that. Of course, if you're doing presentations. One of you may have chose the lazy loading of images and you've explained it very well. And so I would ask everyone

21
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:59.760
Jason Blazzard: Don't delay on looking at the developer forum and those presentations that are well done to help you, you know, solidify your thinking about what's going on here with progressive loading of images this overall idea.

22
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:13.260
Jason Blazzard: Let's just do this one together. Now there's some talk here. But overall, what we're talking about is not everyone has the same experience with your website and it's going to be loaded right so

23
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:28.200
Jason Blazzard: As it loads. We want to try to take advantage of some tools that we can use to present a meaningful image or content is better put

24
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.390
Jason Blazzard: To the users as soon as possible, the things that matter the most. Now one of these techniques that we can use is we can say, hey, let's hold off.

25
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.600
Jason Blazzard: On loading all the images because you as you now know if you've been studying your resources.

26
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:56.430
Jason Blazzard: Those images can take a lot of space. So why not delay them loading until we really need them that, you know, for example, the user start scrolling down because they're interested in additional content.

27
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.350
Jason Blazzard: Right. So that's the term where it comes from, lazy loading. You can read all about it.

28
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:11.910
Jason Blazzard: So higher up the idea is the idea of progressive loading. So we have a sign this reading, which we do need a quiz on

29
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.040
Jason Blazzard: That make sure you don't delay that idea about, okay, yeah. So in the same realm. What's this progressive loading mean

30
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.790
Jason Blazzard: Then there's a video about how to load late images leisurely so called

31
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:40.980
Jason Blazzard: And and we pick these and you could look at others. And of course, maybe you did the presentation or looking at a presentation. They may have used another resource or demonstrated some notes, it's all good. So I want to give you

32
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.320
Jason Blazzard: An overview of what we're going to do. So we're going to create this file called lazy load and then support it with an external CSS file.

33
00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:08.340
Jason Blazzard: And the page will have the standard stuff in it and then five or six pictures that force the page that the user would have to scroll. So I'm just going to stack them on top of each other. Now this video down here does an overview of it all. And if you want to look at that do that.

34
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.120
Jason Blazzard: We don't need to hear this boring voice, you have my boring voice so

35
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.770
Jason Blazzard: You can see here the images are just selected to be large enough. And by the way, if you're ever watching these images.

36
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:32.010
Jason Blazzard: Are these, you should play them and web and document so you can follow along there where they talk about loading the JavaScript in and blurry and then with some basic CSS and know that we're setting a source first for the placeholder.

37
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:40.140
Jason Blazzard: And then resetting the attribute to get the real source of the image you can use your own images or you can use placeholder image sites that provide images where you just make sure that you follow the directions and they're a little bit long.

38
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.490
Jason Blazzard: Here, I think I used 200 400 even asked us to convey foreigner, but really that's not as important as making sure these features works. Okay, so this is what it will look like.

39
00:06:48.180 --> 00:07:05.340
Jason Blazzard: And if you scroll down, just go down the image will be blurred and then take some time to load later but it won't load right away. So that's just the bottom line. So let's get started on this and I'm going to go ahead and do go through some of it and you can of course ask questions, but

40
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:15.420
Jason Blazzard: Let me get in here to create a new file called lazy load, I think, is what they wanted us to call it here in less than seven folder.

41
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:29.340
Jason Blazzard: And I'll create a new file and hater called lazy load. Now you may not have all these other things. But you are going to need them for your gallery page, you don't necessarily have to have a Preston seven though. Again, I would recommend it.

42
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:40.590
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so we have our two files are going to be supported. So in our HTML page. Let's just create a standard interface. So I have a template here, I can just click and get a

43
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:57.720
Jason Blazzard: Some of the stuff I need in there. I'm not too worried about that. But definitely my style sheet is in the CSS folder and I'm going to use a lazy load. Okay, save that are good to go. Currently, my prettier. I'm putting in these closing

44
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.250
Jason Blazzard: Self closing whether or not stuff.

45
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:10.530
Jason Blazzard: On these these tags that don't need a closing tag it puts that in there if that bothers you. Otherwise, it shouldn't really bother you.

46
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.340
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so let's go ahead and decide what we need in here. Well,

47
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:28.680
Jason Blazzard: I don't need all this stuff on my page. I'm not craving a page for the weather site. This is an independent activity page. So I'm just going to have a main section, I think, is all I need.

48
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:38.250
Jason Blazzard: And I need some script in there. So the thing I'm going to have in my main is an H1 and I'm just going to call it progressive

49
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:49.110
Jason Blazzard: loading of images. Okay, fine. Now I'll just get you started here. I'm going to go ahead and select the picture element and

50
00:08:50.790 --> 00:09:04.980
Jason Blazzard: I am going to give it a source of images and list to see if I've downloaded it in here yet. I don't have it, so I'll have to find one called a placeholder, oops, oops, oops.

51
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.050
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

52
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:18.930
Jason Blazzard: This call it placeholder. So what I'm going to create here is that each of these images all load with does something very, very generic and I am going to store it here locally.

53
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:32.520
Jason Blazzard: With me so that happens quickly and I'll do that on all the pictures that I put in here. I'm gonna save that and see what happens. Oh yeah, that's funny. I don't like that. And this one's going to be a picture of

54
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.790
Jason Blazzard: A kitten. So it could be more

55
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.720
Jason Blazzard: Elaborate there. So anyway, there's my image now.

56
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:53.640
Jason Blazzard: So far, so good. We're like, yeah, so what, let's just and I'm just going to do like three of them. Okay, I know that we won't see the action because it's really not going to scroll down the page, but we can go from there. So I need this placeholder image.

57
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.370
Jason Blazzard: I know I have one.

58
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.310
Jason Blazzard: Where do I have that in a different context. So I'm gonna have to get that

59
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.300
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so sorry I gotta go get it. I'll show you what it looks like, what I have

60
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.790
Jason Blazzard: I can go to this guy. My curriculum folder.

61
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.870
Jason Blazzard: Maybe in less than seven images and I have a placeholder know

62
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:28.440
Jason Blazzard: So that's what it looks like it's just a great thing. And I have some text, just so we know, but it is. That's all we're doing.

63
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:36.180
Jason Blazzard: Of course you would do something more advantageous possibly that small form, you know, in terms of size,

64
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:53.220
Jason Blazzard: Ready to load on your page to hold the place of the images, if that's what you need to do. And that's what we're doing here. Okay, so this thing will load first. So I'm going to copy this and I think I just have to go over to my projects into the lab and stick it in here.

65
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:12.510
Jason Blazzard: Okay, good. So now I have that in there. So there it is in my addresses. Okay, so when we look at this, just real quick. We now know that it's just going to look pretty generic and I just want even. I mean, there are 300 by 400 to hold it.

66
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.550
Jason Blazzard: Okay, now I need some CSS to drive this. So let's go ahead and drive it.

67
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:33.450
Jason Blazzard: And I already have my code that I want to use. For example, I want to use. I can just do my quick code. I know I just have it from a generic file or I set up the font. I really should set the font size. It's pretty common.

68
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:46.620
Jason Blazzard: That to be sis pixels. He was not this one. It really doesn't matter. So why spend time on it, but I'm going to go ahead and define that MIT main with a maximum with, I don't need all that within it.

69
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:59.940
Jason Blazzard: And I'm going to display them and flex. I'm going to use flex and the direction is in a column, and I'm going to align the items to the center. Since I'm flex I can use this property to do that. So I save that.

70
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.650
Jason Blazzard: And now they're like, you know, this is not wide enough

71
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:17.730
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so anyway, they they're centered. Now all I have to do is give the H1, a little bit of size. No, I don't. The image. I'm going to go ahead

72
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:30.960
Jason Blazzard: And do you know put a border on it. Put some padding filtered, a little bit. I'm going to blurt it out just to say, this is not the real image I should have sometimes that's a user experience that they're recognized by

73
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.920
Jason Blazzard: Okay, now I need to stop Joanne asked, what is it meant by having the CSS external now not

74
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:44.610
Jason Blazzard: At, are they not put in this yes but external means that

75
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:53.550
Jason Blazzard: This is an external reference to CSS and then I'll do some JavaScript. It'll be external reference. I'll give it a source.

76
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.790
Jason Blazzard: Meaning I don't just embed it in a script. And I don't just embed it as a style tag nor an inline stout because all know what

77
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:12.720
Jason Blazzard: Embedded means I could do in the body. I could do this, I can just type style and it'll work. Right. Okay, everyone got that and, you know, then the third level which is

78
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:20.820
Jason Blazzard: You could style any individual tag what you've been doing, possibly with implementing JavaScript, you could set your styles right in there.

79
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.220
Okay.

80
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.910
Jason Blazzard: Good sorry if I missed. These you might have to yell at me.

81
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:39.780
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so now we're going to do some crazy stuff and you're like, I don't know what you're doing. I don't worry, we kind of walk through it with you in this in this particular

82
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:54.390
Jason Blazzard: Reading I mean all the details, but recognize that it might be a little bit difficult. So there's a little video overview of what's going on. And then I'm showing you a little bit here. Okay, so remember

83
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:03.660
Jason Blazzard: What we're going to do is this image placeholder has one backer and CO simple text like placeholder doesn't really matter what you use.

84
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:15.120
Jason Blazzard: Replace it with real images as soon as each images loaded from its source. So that will be the confusing part you're like, well, how do I do that well that's in the reading. And then the examples.

85
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.940
Jason Blazzard: Alright, so here's what we're going to do.

86
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.460
Jason Blazzard: Okay, we've got that there. Save it.

87
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:36.240
Jason Blazzard: We've got these images started in the end all have lots of them right but let's go ahead and show what we're gonna do is a data source and call it data source property.

88
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:43.680
Jason Blazzard: Okay attribute of this HTML and go ahead and load an image. Now, this could be an image that you have

89
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:51.900
Jason Blazzard: In your images folder, but I'm going to reference. Just because it'll slow things down a little bit to like a third party so I can use place getting

90
00:14:52.620 --> 00:15:05.370
Jason Blazzard: And I can't remember what I made those what was 200 by 400 200 wide by 400 deep and if I just give it that address, then it will do that. Okay.

91
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:12.390
Jason Blazzard: Now on all of them. I wanted to do that. There's a better way to copy. I couldn't remember how to do that in Visual Studio code.

92
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.690
Jason Blazzard: But I can use other ones like

93
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.430
Jason Blazzard: Wow.

94
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:25.500
Jason Blazzard: I don't have to just force it to go into all these different directions and drive you nuts about how much

95
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:35.340
Jason Blazzard: Memory and we're using. So I can use place image. It's another sir free source of placeholder images and I'm going to use a nature pitcher.

96
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:48.060
Jason Blazzard: And let me give you one more just for fun, I pick some photos and the way it wants. It is the same way, like this, and I am gonna let it do whatever it wants.

97
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.650
Jason Blazzard: Whatever okay so

98
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.500
Jason Blazzard: You're probably wondering, okay well this is a new attribute for an image.

99
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:12.510
Jason Blazzard: And it's really cool because there's all sorts of things you can do with data on our elements. But what we're going to do is say, let's just hold those in the background and use some JavaScript to load them.

100
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:27.270
Jason Blazzard: If it's appropriate. And the way that it's appropriate is if it's seen on the page. Now the currently the way we have it if I save this. I don't know why I have all these things loaded. We see two of them. We don't see that third one, right.

101
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:38.430
Jason Blazzard: You know that the images where they're going to be at so far, we haven't told it to load this real ones yet but that's cool. Right, so that we can probably not load that one.

102
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.430
Jason Blazzard: I thought I told them to blur.

103
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.090
Jason Blazzard: I didn't finish that off. Right.

104
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.960
Jason Blazzard: There just images. Yeah. So, all he would just on the page, which is very dangerous. Don't do that. Right.

105
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.650
Jason Blazzard: But again, this page is just pretty small.

106
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.660
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

107
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.600
Jason Blazzard: Where they three. Yeah, you probably have to do 300 400 but again that's

108
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.550
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, do it. If in case your instructor gets upset, but

109
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.300
Cary Taylor: You're

110
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.010
Jason Blazzard: Set to 00 the blur.

111
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.720
Cary Taylor: Correct.

112
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.430
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah, thank you. Thank you.

113
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.790
Jason Blazzard: Alright, so let's go and and

114
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.000
Jason Blazzard: Let's do that.

115
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:39.870
Jason Blazzard: Let's go and write some script to help us do that. So I am going to go here and create an external script file that has the name of image.

116
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.560
Jason Blazzard: Okay, your keyboard is sideways.

117
00:17:45.930 --> 00:18:07.200
Jason Blazzard: Okay image handling JS. Okay, and what am I going to do in here. Well, this code. I'm just going to copy over, but let's just write it out. The first thing to do is get all the images which are I am GS with they have that data source attribute

118
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:21.240
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so I'll create a constant because that won't change and I'll use camel casing to say images to load. I'll go, I'll set you know whatever name I want. Right. I don't need to say that anymore. Right, this is not special.

119
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:30.870
Jason Blazzard: This is up to you. But this is I'm going to go to the document and I'm going to query selector all because I want all of them, and it'll be

120
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:43.020
Jason Blazzard: It'll be a node list of them. And I'll say, go find image, but I have to qualify it with an attribute. So not just find all the images, even though that's all there are right.

121
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:56.820
Jason Blazzard: But they have this data source attributes. So that's how we put in the attribute. Right. And we'll get a node list and like an earring. Right. Think of it like that to node list.

122
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:05.670
Jason Blazzard: Now we can set up parameters for what we call our what this thing that you'll read about his inner sectional observer, which

123
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:17.640
Jason Blazzard: Basically this API will call to help us determine where we're at on the page. So we don't need to know much about it, but we're going to use it, it's all one word. If you want to get technical about how they named it

124
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:24.900
Jason Blazzard: So these are going to be the optional parameters. So I'll just say let's do some options here about

125
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:44.700
Jason Blazzard: And these are somewhat difficult to understand like the threshold, at what point do we start loading this and I'll say, you could say extreme right away all the way to wait till the whole image is going to be appear before I start loading it so we'll just start with zero here.

126
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:51.390
Jason Blazzard: And then I can talk also introduce I was like a margin property here.

127
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.320
Kim DeMille: So we get

128
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.330
Jason Blazzard: Okay, sorry. What

129
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.160
Kim DeMille: Thresholds not spelled right

130
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.410
Jason Blazzard: Oh, thank you. Yeah, eventually I'll get to that problem.

131
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:12.180
Jason Blazzard: I leave. Thank you. So I'll go here and I'll do I have to enter this in like I'll put it in like this for the top

132
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:21.090
Jason Blazzard: And I'm gonna be bad. I'm going to put in the measurements, just so we know what we're talking about 50 pixels into it at the from the bottom.

133
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:29.520
Jason Blazzard: So you could play with these numbers again these are optional. And there's assumed, I think if you leave it off thresholds zero and margins all zero.

134
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:43.890
Jason Blazzard: And again, I am not just pulling this out of the air and saying, Hey, go learn it. Go. You'll figure it out. No, we gave you the reading here and was will pull this up. If it's was this it. Yeah.

135
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:56.700
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, that's my video. Right. So it talks in detail about each of those attributes. Okay. Are those settings and options.

136
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.780
Jason Blazzard: So you're like, where is it well.

137
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.540
Kim DeMille: It was in the video.

138
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.370
Jason Blazzard: I was in the video. Yeah, and wrong page. So watch the video.

139
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.490
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

140
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.110
Jason Blazzard: Watch this video to you can help others.

141
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:35.550
Jason Blazzard: So play with those and see what happens. Again, you're gonna have to mimic a situation there. It won't just happen automatically. So this. The following is given, we're going to create a concept called load images and we're going to set up here, our function using an arrow function.

142
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.250
Jason Blazzard: Like this.

143
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.870
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

144
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:48.030
Jason Blazzard: Alright, so this is given, we're going to talk to each image. Okay, and we're going to say, hey,

145
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.820
Jason Blazzard: Let's set the attribute

146
00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:01.500
Jason Blazzard: Of source, right, we'd have to give it that argument for set attribute it wants to know which which attribute. Do you want to set

147
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:14.430
Jason Blazzard: And then what value do you want. So the value that comes next, it's showing you right here trying to help you. What value do you want, and it has to be a string, but ours is going to of course we're going to go to the image and get something that already exists.

148
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:24.870
Jason Blazzard: Okay, we're going to get an attribute and we all know what the attribute. It's called, it's called data source. So don't get confused that we'd have to put

149
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.850
Jason Blazzard: brackets around it. We only had to do that when we're using like a query selector a query selector all

150
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:42.330
Jason Blazzard: In that argument list to do that here we're just getting an attribute and we're naming what it is and stick it in. And as a string right here. So what does that do well. You can imagine what that does, right.

151
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:58.440
Jason Blazzard: Let's look at this, it goes to here and it says all the sources. Currently this, but it just told me to set the source differently and give it whatever values in here. So, that makes sense. You're like okay, I'm going to replace the placeholder with an actual image okay in that

152
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.950
Jason Blazzard: piece right there and then

153
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.350
Jason Blazzard: When it loads.

154
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:19.260
Jason Blazzard: Will do the unload will create an anonymous function here because we have to and just use URL pointer to say this is what we're going to go do we're going to go the image and we're going to remove an attribute

155
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.240
Jason Blazzard: Just because we don't need it and it shows in the video.

156
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:35.640
Jason Blazzard: And we don't need that data source right after we've set it to source. We're good. We're set. We're done. It's all good. So I think we've ended that and

157
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:51.150
Jason Blazzard: Into that line. So I know a little confusing and you're probably wondering well, how did you get this stuff you know images is too low, but you have them, but you haven't, you know, use that yet. And that is true. Okay.

158
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.380
Jason Blazzard: So here's the given code.

159
00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:06.450
Jason Blazzard: We first what we should do is check to make sure it's allowed and if it is allowed. Then we'll create this called, you know,

160
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:14.280
Jason Blazzard: We're going to first check to see if the I O. The Intersection Observer is supported.

161
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:27.810
Jason Blazzard: And if it is allowed. So you use the F block. And that's really all I want you to think about because this stuff is given to you say, you know, how do I use to say this, this API. And it's like, oh yeah, this is how to use it and

162
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:37.560
Jason Blazzard: I know what if block does. You know, we don't want to try to force this if it doesn't happen. And again, there are examples of what you could do if it didn't.

163
00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.270
Absurd

164
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.250
Jason Blazzard: support it.

165
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:49.200
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so that's the key word for it, we just checked to say if that's in the window.

166
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.660
Jason Blazzard: That supports it.

167
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.910
Jason Blazzard: All right. And now we're going to use it. We're going to say, hey,

168
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.820
Jason Blazzard: Create a new instance of this object we have to do that.

169
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.880
Jason Blazzard: And we'll feed it

170
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.610
Jason Blazzard: The items right

171
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.280
Jason Blazzard: And

172
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.280
Jason Blazzard: Observer here.

173
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.740
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

174
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.120
Jason Blazzard: All right. Yeah, I know this is lot. So this is just something that you would copy

175
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:44.340
Jason Blazzard: All right, so I think I've got that misplaced. We've got calls to this function. What do I do for each of them. I go to items for each item is a for each to loop through them all.

176
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.600
Jason Blazzard: And

177
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.850
Jason Blazzard: What are we going to do. We are going to

178
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:03.420
Jason Blazzard: Well, we just take each of these items. That's all we should have to do. Right. Yeah, that's all we need to do.

179
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.230
Jason Blazzard: Now let me just copy the code that they gave us where we call finally all these things that we've built

180
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:23.670
Jason Blazzard: So items is going through. So we're, you know, where do we get that right, that came in from here, new Intersection Observer. We're looking for those items. And for each one.

181
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:35.220
Jason Blazzard: We see if it's intersecting and we load images so load images as backup here it says, Yeah, I have this. This is what I'll do, and the item target has given

182
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:42.570
Jason Blazzard: Each each each image and then you can observe it. So that's what's given to us.

183
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:54.390
Jason Blazzard: Now on this is right here's where I stick those options that I set up above about when to do it. That's how it wants to be fed so often what you're doing.

184
00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:04.440
Jason Blazzard: Is you're consuming these third party scripts of code, so they can be a little bit daunting like this, you're like, I'm not sure what all is going on.

185
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.100
Jason Blazzard: But at this point, we just want you to go through the experience or I do

186
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:25.560
Jason Blazzard: Others debate that, but I'm like, you have to because this is what you'll be doing, you'll be finding these options, say, Yeah, let's go ahead and employ this progressive loading and use the Intersection Observer. How do I do that. Well, I find that article I find the example and I

187
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:39.960
Jason Blazzard: properly put into the code in and to understand the details is maybe not so important right now. It could be over time, but just the general idea of what's going on is

188
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.040
Jason Blazzard: Good enough.

189
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.650
chad.rodee@getweave.com: You tell me about the devil parentheses around like items item.

190
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.650
Right here.

191
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.250
Jason Blazzard: Is this one you're one you're talking about

192
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.430
chad.rodee@getweave.com: Yeah, it doesn't see the closing bracket to that.

193
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:05.610
Jason Blazzard: Yeah. So what what's happening here is, you know, like on a for each loop you say okay for each, and then you normally say

194
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:31.830
Jason Blazzard: You give it a name and then you look at you know like if it's saying for each do the following function and this is what we have to feed it an item. Now, this will be a little bit confusing because you're like, Whoa, wait a second.

195
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:44.550
Jason Blazzard: You know, where did you do this, you know, where is this thing. And so we'll show that in a second. Because really, it just says here. If this is true, then we're going to be able to create this constant

196
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.910
Jason Blazzard: And it is created the structures made ready to be used, but we haven't even used it yet. We're not done yet.

197
00:28:52.230 --> 00:29:06.480
Jason Blazzard: But I think back to your question on the for each we're actually feeding it a function. So this is an argument of the function. And we just use instead of creating, you know, a call out to the function we're using. And you know this.

198
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.150
Jason Blazzard: This arrow to say, hey, this is what we're doing in between here.

199
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.940
Jason Blazzard: Right, and then the whole thing is surrounded here. So it's actually between here.

200
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.040
Jason Blazzard: Alright so that was given to us what to do for them. Let's actually call it

201
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.500
Jason Blazzard: We're still in this block right

202
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.070
Kim DeMille: Can I just ask a quick question.

203
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:50.340
Kim DeMille: Yeah, okay. So when I did mine. It works. In the end, but it had an error when I when I was running it to start off with, and that was to do with up by the threshold where you have this little red zero

204
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.590
Kim DeMille: Yes, um,

205
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.540
Kim DeMille: It kept coming with an error to that until I put it in.

206
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.890
Kim DeMille: In linking it in quotes.

207
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.360
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah, that's horrible is red. So that's a problem.

208
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.770
Kim DeMille: Okay, so I didn't know if that was part of your pretty code or if it was

209
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.870
Jason Blazzard: It's helping me out there and

210
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.400
Jason Blazzard: I forget what article that is it's right off of here.

211
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.480
Kim DeMille: So i mean i i had to put it in quotes. I just didn't know if

212
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:21.990
Kim DeMille: It was like

213
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:28.800
Kim DeMille: Gonna flag. If it, if that was right or wrong, but it seemed totally work when I put it in, in quotes.

214
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.380
Jason Blazzard: Right now, I was just going to show you the it's

215
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.670
Jason Blazzard: The API.

216
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.160
Anna B.: A little. It was in the progressive

217
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.490
Jason Blazzard: Right here, I see I had this is what I have

218
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.760
Oh, you said it was up here.

219
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.610
Jason Blazzard: So I thought I was fine doing that.

220
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.530
Jason Blazzard: Where did you say it was

221
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:53.790
Anna B.: Me just go a little bit lower. It's right under the blur. It's in the it talks about the observer there. Just keep going. Just a little more

222
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.650
Anna B.: Right there.

223
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.670
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, but I don't see the options.

224
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:04.770
Anna B.: Here's all the code that oh yeah no the options. I didn't. I only heard I saw in the video with that.

225
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.480
Kim DeMille: Video. He didn't use it like that either. But until I put it

226
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.140
Kim DeMille: That's weird. It kept on not working so

227
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.960
Kim DeMille: Well, you can mark down for that or

228
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.770
Jason Blazzard: Mark down, we don't care about marking down we care about.

229
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.350
Kim DeMille: Mostly

230
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.700
Kim DeMille: I wanted it anyway. So I don't know.

231
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.050
Jason Blazzard: It's gotta work. Yeah. So let's, this looks bad, though.

232
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:31.830
It does.

233
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.380
Jason Blazzard: Why does it look bad.

234
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.150
Kim DeMille: coronavirus it's terrible.

235
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:37.410
Kim DeMille: Okay.

236
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.250
Jason Blazzard: So you say, do that. And that's happy. Oh, we'll see.

237
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.060
Kim DeMille: Yeah.

238
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.180
Jason Blazzard: I like that zero. Well, let's finish this puppy, though.

239
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:54.510
Jason Blazzard: Last thing we I mean we're really we're creating all these things. And we're like, where do you ever use them. I use that one here, but where do you use this image observer, you set it all up.

240
00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:00.990
Jason Blazzard: And you created these crazy names like each item and items and how you feed it, that would be everyone's question.

241
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:12.480
Jason Blazzard: So we finally say, hey, this is working. And we set up those options. Let's call images to load which we've set up to be this notice so

242
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:22.290
Jason Blazzard: All the way back up here. We created a node list. This contains all the images. It was hey let's process this so we'll use a for each one, since it is a node minutes

243
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:37.800
Jason Blazzard: And we'll send it whatever name we want. It's like every x, we could make this x. If we wanted to every but it's like every image in this. Let's do the following. Think about like that. So the more we exposure to that, the better.

244
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.410
Jason Blazzard: Of course, don't do that.

245
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.250
Jason Blazzard: And then we just say, Hey, so what we'll do is we'll use that image observer, the way we set it up.

246
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:59.670
Jason Blazzard: And we'll use a built in method in there. So it's like it. This is an object that we call that we don't really know the inner workings of except how to use it by documentation.

247
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:10.710
Jason Blazzard: So this, this class has these things in it right methods that are built in functions and one of them's observe and we have to send it each image.

248
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:22.560
Jason Blazzard: And so really what's happening, it is that's where it receives them is items. There's the observer. Did I yeah that's the way they called it right

249
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:30.360
Jason Blazzard: throws me off a little bit, but I'll keep it like that. And then this other parameters items. So that's actually every image.

250
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:45.570
Jason Blazzard: So it's a node list and we're going to march through each one and we're going to check them. And we're going to do load images by basically replacing each of those by that. So a lot of work to get that done, but it's in play for us. Now the else branches to says

251
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:53.280
Jason Blazzard: Well, you, you can do this. So what we're going to do is just load images. And what will that do

252
00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:02.430
Jason Blazzard: Well, it doesn't support the Intersection Observer. So we're nearly not concerned about all these options. We had, we're just going to load the images.

253
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:20.370
Jason Blazzard: The best weekend. That makes sense. We're like, we don't care how long it takes. We're just not going to get the real effect from the inner sectional observer, because the intersection is not supported by the browser which like Internet Explorer probably doesn't support it.

254
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.500
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so that's ugly, right, but you're like, Hey, I just copied that and I'm good.

255
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:33.450
Jason Blazzard: However, we probably should do some stuff here. We don't have to do

256
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.910
Jason Blazzard: Are we good. Everyone good about it.

257
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:40.590
Yeah.

258
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.350
Jason Blazzard: I'll see if I can make it happen.

259
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.440
Jason Blazzard: I'd already did it.

260
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.470
Jason Blazzard: So brother Blizzard is going to fail. So we'll refer to my video.

261
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.620
Jason Blazzard: We'll just go here.

262
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:04.980
Jason Blazzard: No errors. So someone helped me did it load real fast. Is that my problem. Now, it didn't load them all did something though.

263
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:15.360
Jason Blazzard: And the video I show you in the main each of these pictures being replaced by that. So I messed something up.

264
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.670
Jason Blazzard: Easy to do

265
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.790
Jason Blazzard: Yikes.

266
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.060
quotes around the 00

267
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:41.040
Jason Blazzard: Yes, thank you. Oh, Kim have that she's like you, you dumb. Had I told you that was a problem. I was hoping this thing would bark at me, though, you know, for the sources. Oh, that's interesting. How can this not loading up

268
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:49.320
Jason Blazzard: You little doggy. What am I doing wrong here. Oh, I know. Brother browsers don't know. I never even referenced it

269
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:59.970
Jason Blazzard: JavaScript image handling. So that was my clue right there. I did a little. I don't even. It doesn't even know what to do, is like you're not telling me, do you have just shown some pictures and

270
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:09.270
Jason Blazzard: So let's save that and we'll go back to that air. I hope it's in there. Now you have some warning, but there they are. Whoa, I gotta fix that.

271
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.580
How can I fix that.

272
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:17.580
Jason Blazzard: I don't want this.

273
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:37.470
Jason Blazzard: Yeah I want back like that. Maybe I didn't want that placeholder blurred and I'll just all blur out these to show that they're working overtime. So this is how I create a selector for particular images, just like I did with the query selector all and I will do some CSS here.

274
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.350
Jason Blazzard: I'll blur it and just give it a little bit guys don't need to go crazy right

275
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.150
Jason Blazzard: Remember that measurement is based upon its parent font size.

276
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.720
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so we got to slow this puppy down

277
00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:06.060
Jason Blazzard: And there's, you know, now I could see that that's getting there. I do have these but it probably unrelated yeah cross site whenever I'm using third party doesn't like it because they're not secure and I just say go away.

278
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.470
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

279
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.300
Jason Blazzard: This

280
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:20.970
Jason Blazzard: Let's slow it down. So what I can do is go into the device toolbar and I could say, I'm in a low end or a mid tier and reload this page.

281
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.670
Jason Blazzard: Maybe it'll work.

282
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.120
Jason Blazzard: Maybe it there so

283
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:34.140
Jason Blazzard: Eventually, see that and I scroll down that pictures there, but we're on a low end. So it's like

284
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.720
Jason Blazzard: Let's do mid tier

285
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.120
Jason Blazzard: reload it

286
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:56.340
Jason Blazzard: And watch us it watch down here. Oh, that's too soon. Huh. So you have to decide using these attributes right here how fast you want it to load. So that's again explained in the video to and I'm showing it here, you can play with that.

287
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.090
Jason Blazzard: What I'm doing wrong here, adding stuff.

288
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.520
Jason Blazzard: All who added the space.

289
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.570
Jason Blazzard: All right.

290
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:17.640
Jason Blazzard: Clear as mud. So you just have to create something like that. And if you're frustrated the codes provided. I don't think we type it out for you though.

291
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.850
Jason Blazzard: But it is in here. You'll find it.

292
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:28.320
Jason Blazzard: And then you probably want to translate it to your actual page for your gallery, because we also want those too lazy load.

293
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.670
Jason Blazzard: Alright so I'm sure there'd be lots of questions.

294
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:49.470
Cary Taylor: One on the bottom of that. Thanks, a third one up. You're supposed to lazy load and then also do it when you scroll down, so we set up the first couple pages.

295
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.420
Cary Taylor: Do are

296
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.480
Cary Taylor: Like that each in blurred.

297
00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:01.290
Jason Blazzard: Alright. The blurred just helps us realize that it's loading. You know, it went through the process.

298
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:16.440
Jason Blazzard: And eventually loads and that let's watch that, just like we do in the video, just so we can see what's happening. So there the sources finally place kitten. Right. What happened to my original placeholder or watch this. Hopefully, select this puppy.

299
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.140
Jason Blazzard: So there's that.

300
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:32.460
Jason Blazzard: It's too fast. But what happens is that original CSS applies to it takes away the blur. I hope everyone saw that, like, if it's an image. There's no blur.

301
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:43.800
Jason Blazzard: But the data source blurs it. But as soon as that's taken away. It's like, yeah, we're not learning that anymore. It's, it's goofy. I know, because you're like a lot. It was blurred imager.

302
00:39:44.760 --> 00:40:01.110
Jason Blazzard: And this that's just one way to handle it in the end it's there. But yeah, if I scroll down, we're not showing it until we're at a convenient point again. I'm in a mid tier mobile. So that loads. I'm just online and do this.

303
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.600
Jason Blazzard: Should be faster. Yeah, little faster on real time of what my machine allows

304
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.080
Jason Blazzard: Yeah yeah

305
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.390
Jason Blazzard: OK, so

306
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:27.210
Jason Blazzard: The gallery. And I want to show you some hints about this. So that's just an activity, right, just go through that and

307
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.490
Jason Blazzard: Let's look at the assignment.

308
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.700
Jason Blazzard: So that's right here.

309
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.860
Jason Blazzard: So you're going to add the gallery seven

310
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:51.030
Jason Blazzard: And you'll have nine images and the recent we've chosen nine for developmental reasons so that you will have to scroll, because in a large screen. These can go across.

311
00:40:51.840 --> 00:41:09.360
Jason Blazzard: Okay so small view you stack them all of them in a medium view it's two columns and three columns in the large view. So you could choose any layout method, you want to use. But I would suggest the easiest would be grid.

312
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:22.680
Jason Blazzard: The images must not load until the user scrolls. So you really can't test that always that you do something like we just did. Now for the gallery page and you

313
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:39.540
Jason Blazzard: You know you scroll through it and have that same effect. The other little thing is they have the box shadow effect, which is just like this when your mouse passes over it only in the large view. By the way, do you put this border around it. I think it's only in the large view.

314
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:42.150
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, large view.

315
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:51.150
Jason Blazzard: Okay. Clear as mud. Those are the things you're doing. So where do you get your pictures. Well, that's up to you, but I want to talk to you about pictures.

316
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.580
Jason Blazzard: Like, here's a problem with these pictures. These are like temples that, you know, who cares.

317
00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:06.600
Jason Blazzard: But they're all different sizes because I'm using a third party source. The churches site to feed me their temple pictures and I'm not caring about

318
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:19.500
Jason Blazzard: What they are. I'm just using them as 100% within their container. So there's a couple of lessons here really Oh with your images, you'd, you know, to solve that, because I could go through here and say, hey,

319
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:28.980
Jason Blazzard: I want these images to be, you know, you see some problems they're there, they're not expanding their containers and that's because of why

320
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:42.540
Jason Blazzard: Let's pick the pace in tempo here right here. It's 800-538-5823 remind you that I am killing this networking. I hope the instructor did this like tested how much you're loading or something similar.

321
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.310
Jason Blazzard: And said, yeah, you're at 17 megs, that's not allowed. How much do we allow

322
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:54.900
Jason Blazzard: 500 but for these image galleries, we're a little bit lenient I am but check with your instructor, if they're going to check that.

323
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:03.990
Jason Blazzard: Because otherwise you'd have to really knock down the quality of all nine of those images to meet that 900 that 500 kilobyte. I mean, we're at 70 mix.

324
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:12.480
Jason Blazzard: So this example I'm giving here, put it right in your mind. I'm gathering. I'm just, I'm just chunk in the network. I'm going and hitting that

325
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:28.230
Jason Blazzard: Third party serves over and over again. So it's not like what you should be doing. You'll have your images refined sized correctly. Again, don't make them any bigger than what you need the maximum size you need

326
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:38.190
Jason Blazzard: Not like what I'm doing. That's 800 by 553 and I'm knocking it down to 396 I because I'm using 100% with which is just a cheap way of doing it.

327
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:47.910
Jason Blazzard: And you have to think about this deeply. You have to say, oh, yeah, you make 100% with because it's contained within this anchor tag, but that doesn't have a width.

328
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:54.780
Jason Blazzard: And is contained within the section called with a class most and because I have a with well

329
00:43:55.290 --> 00:44:03.990
Jason Blazzard: It's in a flex column in you know in there. But that's just these items, this, this and this. What about the grid. Oh yeah, it's a grid.

330
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:13.680
Jason Blazzard: That's gonna force. It's with. So if I just say 100% here. It's not going to exceed what its parent or grandparent is decided it's with it's going to be maximum

331
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:23.910
Jason Blazzard: By the way, I use a display grid here because I'm using I'm using the advantage of grid to be responsive without me doing a lot of work. I'm not gonna

332
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:30.690
Jason Blazzard: I'm not doing a lot of work. I just say hey yeah just make this whole big diff here within my main I have this H2 and this div.

333
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:42.450
Jason Blazzard: Let's make this whole big give a grid, and then I will put in the columns template comes as a repeat of however many I need based upon auto fit.

334
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:54.510
Jason Blazzard: And the size. Wow. The minimum, you can use a min max and say the minimum. It could be as 320 the maximum that it can be is one fractional unit, just to fill up the allowable space.

335
00:44:54.930 --> 00:45:03.180
Jason Blazzard: Then it does whatever it needs. Now you guys always associated with your assignment, you're like well you on the you can't the assignment.

336
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:21.030
Jason Blazzard: Right. But that's a different ballgame. But it's the same principle. What is the assignment want you to do probably create a template with three fractional units for the large and two for the medium and one for the small so much easier. Right. But again, look at these pictures.

337
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.900
Jason Blazzard: How can I solve them. Well, I could say all images.

338
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:47.220
Jason Blazzard: Was the height auto I could change it right there. I'll go do that. And I could say, hey, they're all just to force it 200 pixels. Well, this is a bad idea. Now it looks better. They fit right no fit in there, same size even Salt Lake. But why is it a bad idea.

339
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:55.410
Jason Blazzard: Because bringing me. I'm going to roll over in his grave. He's rolling over right now is that are just digging through turn that piece down but

340
00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:05.070
Jason Blazzard: I guess they're really not. They're just digging all the way under but it looks pixelated. So you got to be careful about aspect ratio and stuff. That's why you

341
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:24.240
Jason Blazzard: Edit the photos beforehand in your editing software and get them the way you want them in. Yes, you can go down from that maximum size that won't be a problem, so long as you don't create this weird aspect ratio by setting the width and the height, are you crazy just create an auto

342
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.120
Jason Blazzard: Is that clear as mud.

343
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:36.330
Jason Blazzard: All right, good. Mary talked about the number one temples in here. This is the number one temple in the world. All right, let's go back.

344
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.300
Jason Blazzard: To this

345
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.910
Jason Blazzard: Questions about this.

346
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.410
Anna B.: Yes. Oh.

347
00:46:48.360 --> 00:47:00.630
Anna B.: Sorry, did you explain again how you want to in the larger view. What's only in the large view. And then what's in the small as far as like are the captions only in the large fee and not in the small or how

348
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.200
Jason Blazzard: I'm captions can be in every

349
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.400
Anna B.: View. Okay.

350
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.220
Jason Blazzard: I think we say you have to have captions, do we

351
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.610
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, we do. We do, we do.

352
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:21.510
Jason Blazzard: We do so I'm I'm inclined to use what you call a figure. You don't have to because it has a natural fig caption with it.

353
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:35.970
Jason Blazzard: But no, our this person has style that so it feels like they're together right so in the large view and all views you have all of this. It's just that the large view, it looks like this.

354
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:46.950
Jason Blazzard: In the medium view. I hate to use this because this has nothing to do with it. And the medium view it's two columns right in the small view it's one column.

355
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:47.520
Anna B.: Okay.

356
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.940
Jason Blazzard: And this will really help you with your lazy loading right because it you know you can lazy load all those down.

357
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:55.350
Anna B.: Okay.

358
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:01.440
Jason Blazzard: By the way, I'm going to go to Vernal Utah I've decided it's only four hours away.

359
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.300
Jason Blazzard: All right.

360
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:04.740
Anna B.: Thank you.

361
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:13.170
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, good questions because it might be a little we don't show a video of what it should look like. But this is showing the large view in. Yeah.

362
00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:19.260
Jason Blazzard: No large view again it should only view that you should have the box shadow property applied.

363
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.100
Anna B.: For the hover.

364
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.360
Jason Blazzard: Hover yeah

365
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.840
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

366
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:30.930
Anna B.: But we can have a shadow, like always, and then just have it more shadow for the hover. Is that kind of

367
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.690
Jason Blazzard: Well who's close to you and

368
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:35.640
Anna B.: Dr Cheney's

369
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.690
Anna B.: For the Cine

370
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.370
Jason Blazzard: Oh, he'll. I don't know.

371
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.500
Jason Blazzard: Okay.

372
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:44.430
Jason Blazzard: I'm sure it's fine. I don't know how picky his and his assessments.

373
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.040
Jason Blazzard: You should be okay.

374
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.950
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, good questions.

375
00:48:52.380 --> 00:49:00.900
Jason Blazzard: Now you're going to help your competitive is in the less classes with your posts about how to put in this Intersection Observer right

376
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.730
Anna B.: I already did.

377
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.090
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah, well I and I know you do.

378
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.920
Jason Blazzard: Your good Alex. I'm going to go to your page as the

379
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:12.900
Jason Blazzard: Orientation images matter, do they

380
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.500
Jason Blazzard: Can they be vertical and explain that to me, Miriam. What does that mean vertical

381
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.610
Jason Blazzard: But this is we want three columns. Right.

382
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:35.640
Miriam: Right, right. Just like the example you did with the kittens. They are in tennis. It's hurry Santo now I'm in his birthday concert of horizontal

383
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:37.710
Cary Taylor: portrait to landscape.

384
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.720
Miriam: Exactly. Yeah, that's it.

385
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.840
Jason Blazzard: Oh, doesn't matter. No.

386
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:58.350
Jason Blazzard: It's up to you. It's just typically whether pictures are in landscape, but it doesn't matter. It's up to you. I would just suggest that they all kind of have the same size and general format that will make your life easier.

387
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.540
Miriam: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

388
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.410
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, good question, Alex. Should we go to your page.

389
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:04.920
Yes.

390
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.110
Alex: Yes, please.

391
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.660
Jason Blazzard: All right. And what, what are you going to show us through this page.

392
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.600
Alex: I just want to say if is a sub k why I'm doing

393
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:22.500
Jason Blazzard: This is like f work. So you would get zero points on mine.

394
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.140
Jason Blazzard: I'm just kidding. Alex

395
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:35.610
Jason Blazzard: You know, it's beautiful. I do this, I do this, I go into inspect I check it out.

396
00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.860
Jason Blazzard: I see that it does this. They're all the same size.

397
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:45.840
Jason Blazzard: Notice that this is active. That's good.

398
00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.050
Jason Blazzard: Go in here and audit.

399
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.540
Jason Blazzard: Let's do the mobile audit.

400
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.490
Jason Blazzard: Beautiful work. I think you're a little crunched on your menu.

401
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.360
Jason Blazzard: We just checked this. Oh, you got a problem.

402
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.750
Jason Blazzard: So you got a problem on this logo.

403
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:17.340
Jason Blazzard: That would be minus one in my book, so I go here. This image is 128 by 128 you then go change it to 100 by 117

404
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:38.460
Jason Blazzard: I know it's not the gallery, but this is something that's because you put it with on it, which is fine but you changed units you went to from 65% to a fixed pixel again not might be fine, but I usually say Lou, warning, warning, warning and then let's see why is the height gone crazy

405
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.560
Jason Blazzard: There's no height set right, am I missing it.

406
00:51:45.840 --> 00:52:00.150
Jason Blazzard: No height, somehow you lose the aspect ratio. So it's 128 this should be 100 by 100 when it comes out of there and it's probably because it's something else that you have. Now, why do you have to tell it that

407
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.040
Jason Blazzard: You don't

408
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:12.960
Jason Blazzard: Naturally box out level elements with no other notation are 100% so I could take that off. You see door.

409
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.470
Jason Blazzard: I'm looking for a reason why

410
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.070
Jason Blazzard: You're

411
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.690
Jason Blazzard: I don't see it. I don't see it, Alex. Somewhere in here, you're

412
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.240
Jason Blazzard: You're doing it and I can't see it.

413
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:42.330
Jason Blazzard: You see how it goes from 128 to 100 by 117 it should be 100 by 100. I don't know why it's trying to fill up the space.

414
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.030
Get this going here.

415
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.720
Jason Blazzard: Huh.

416
00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:56.250
Jason Blazzard: I don't know. So, in your case, we'll just put height.

417
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:59.460
Jason Blazzard: And it still doesn't change. It did it.

418
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.650
Jason Blazzard: That's so bad, but that's the reason that Bart.

419
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.110
Jason Blazzard: It barked at you.

420
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.140
Jason Blazzard: That's the correct aspect ratio.

421
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:20.100
Jason Blazzard: I don't know, though, Alex. I mean, is this Alex Yeah. Alex, I don't know why did that, though, because you're not telling it to be a certain height.

422
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:36.570
Jason Blazzard: Which is usually the default is auto and when I put auto it didn't really adjust it so that's a mystery to me. So I'll just force it since. That's it. That's an easy calculation. It's a square

423
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.760
Jason Blazzard: Good job on this, though. Beautiful. And yeah, you can make your choices, the way you want.

424
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.370
Jason Blazzard: It. Anything else on this. Oh, let's look at network just so everyone's not freaking out.

425
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:56.610
Jason Blazzard: 612. So, you know, to me, You better check with your instructor. I'm just still okay with that because I'm like, yeah, it's a gallery page people know

426
00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:08.460
Jason Blazzard: It's loaded a bunch of images and of course we could expand upon this and of course make each of these clickable and blow up in the full screen. We don't even do that a lot of people want to do that. So if you want to do that, then

427
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:14.850
Jason Blazzard: Go figure it out. Do it. That's worth your time. That's what you bet you don't have to do that.

428
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:23.370
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah, the thing I was worried about is this is a little tight, you must make that a bigger yeah it's a bigger font.

429
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:29.130
Jason Blazzard: So be careful about I know I'm getting really picky really picky.

430
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.410
Jason Blazzard: I almost would reduce this size, so it doesn't scroll down, because that's happening there again.

431
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:39.660
Jason Blazzard: What the heck

432
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:46.260
Jason Blazzard: Yeah look at that 100 by something is, I love the browser needs to figure that out.

433
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.110
Jason Blazzard: It's what is that

434
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.380
Why

435
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:54.720
Jason Blazzard: He

436
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.660
Jason Blazzard: You say display flex but

437
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.600
Jason Blazzard: You say justify

438
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:10.170
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, this flex says I'm going to fill up the space if you just put the height as 100 you're gonna be okay but

439
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:12.450
Jason Blazzard: Yeah.

440
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.430
Jason Blazzard: Yeah yeah

441
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.380
Jason Blazzard: Okay, good, good, good, good.

442
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:23.250
Jason Blazzard: Job, Alex. Okay, so

443
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.690
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah. Does everyone know the new

444
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.160
Jason Blazzard: Password to the church.

445
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:39.600
Jason Blazzard: Why is it referencing the Leona, that's your thing to reflect on everybody knows the church Wi Fi is LDS Church.

446
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:41.910
Jason Blazzard: Right, that's the name

447
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:53.730
Jason Blazzard: And y'all know the password to get on the Wi Fi and every church is what pioneer 47 what 74. Yeah. Yeah, well it's pioneer

448
00:55:54.270 --> 00:56:05.970
Jason Blazzard: That's okay. Joe, I'm just kidding. So everyone knows what that was about. Right, right. What does it mean eight teen 47. So what's the new one. It's all about the Leona. And this scripture right here.

449
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.900
Jason Blazzard: And of course we have to get rid of LDS

450
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.760
Jason Blazzard: I think next week. You can no longer type lds.org

451
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.630
marieroe: I think you can't already in some places.

452
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.370
Jason Blazzard: It's beautiful. Huh.

453
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.640
Jason Blazzard: Now it for us. And I'm just kidding, you always will be able to get it.

454
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:34.590
Jason Blazzard: I'm just, just kidding least I don't have to type the Church of Jesus Christ, because if we did

455
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.790
Jason Blazzard: Cuz that's what I want. You're going to get this third party church.

456
00:56:42.990 --> 00:57:03.810
Jason Blazzard: Well, if you go to it. Anyway, I'll stop.org yeah these people have it right because they called it The Church of Jesus Christ registered trademark. We're like, Dang it. Well, of course, we're Latter Day Saints, but we would have loved up on that one. Wait a second, wait a second.

457
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.230
Jason Blazzard: Looks like they put up the sacred grove there.

458
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.970
Jason Blazzard: What, wait a second. We took that over

459
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.120
Jason Blazzard: That's not legal.

460
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.560
Jason Blazzard: Anyway, I better stop.

461
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:19.860
Jason Blazzard: You know,

462
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.110
Kim DeMille: I'm messing up the ones that are out of Nauvoo on a the reorganize door.

463
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.930
Jason Blazzard: Yeah, but I thought it was completely different.

464
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.250
Anna B.: Their community of Christ, the one and not do I thought that's what 30 months.

465
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:33.510
Kim DeMille: It was name.

466
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.510
marieroe: It's the same church they just switched over there.

467
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:37.350
Yeah.

468
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.360
Jason Blazzard: Yeah.

469
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.650
Jason Blazzard: There's lots

470
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.820
marieroe: A few years ago.

471
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.360
Jason Blazzard: Just look at the 16 churches and independence.

472
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.770
Kim DeMille: So, did I miss. Did you ever actually tell us what the new password was

473
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.460
Jason Blazzard: I'm not supposed to, I think, so I won't. Did someone type it don't type it.

474
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:57.720
marieroe: It's a news article you can look it up, or at least I got it as a letter.

475
00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:58.620
Kim DeMille: It's a look

476
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.970
Kim DeMille: You can dangle. The carrot in front of me and not tell me. So tell me,

477
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:23.610
Jason Blazzard: Here it is. I just told you what the Scripture is is the password and it's now called What's the new. It's called Leona right the Wi Fi networks called Leona. And then it's a scripture. So Alma 3738

478
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.380
Kim DeMille: Thank you.

479
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.150
Cary Taylor: I think if we were to have to type in the whole Scripture we would remember it better.

480
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.590
Jason Blazzard: Password. Yeah, let's do that. That's great.

481
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:42.270
Kim DeMille: Jesus Christ.

482
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:44.580
Kim DeMille: Yeah yeah

483
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.320
Jason Blazzard: Okay, so anyway.

484
00:58:52.830 --> 00:59:07.230
Jason Blazzard: This is fun stuff too, though, you can do shape outside if you want it. You could probably do a lot more object fits pretty cool. You should watch this lady. If you want to do lot more design stuff. It's really interesting. She works with Mozilla

485
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:17.430
Jason Blazzard: Oh good, Chelsea. So I think we've given her you some of her videos already so you might dig a little bit deeper if you're interested.

486
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:26.820
Jason Blazzard: If you don't know an API means to the application programming interface on interfaces, a programming term talks about this contract between

487
00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:44.490
Jason Blazzard: Two parties and what it will do, even though it's not the class itself. It's built in to there and a lot of times we just consume them and will will continue to consume. Well, we should will consume what we call a weather API that's free to give us the live weather for our site.

488
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:59.490
Jason Blazzard: This is a another example of lazy loading that using a little bit different methods. So you're probably not interested in it. But anyway, it's here you'll find them all over the web.

489
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.480
Jason Blazzard: But really they're doing similar things.

490
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.580
Jason Blazzard: But you could find that in my code pinned

491
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.450
Jason Blazzard: All right. What came out today in the church.

492
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.220
Jason Blazzard: The new handbook. So you have everything can look at

493
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.270
Cary Taylor: Me gospel living app is out to

494
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.090
Jason Blazzard: Oh yeah and that's good one right

495
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:28.830
For the youth.

496
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:35.520
Jason Blazzard: Now, Rick, do you work for the church was Rick and in this list.

497
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.290
Might have left no Rick there you're

498
01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:45.900
Jason Blazzard: Over YouTube, don't you, and what aspect, tell us again.

499
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:56.850
marieroe: I'm a church operator. So anytime you call into the church 24 hours a day 365 days a year we answer the phone.

500
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.900
Jason Blazzard: You physically go somewhere to do that or at home. Yeah.

501
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.300
marieroe: I go down to the church headquarters office.

502
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.110
Downtown

503
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:09.210
Jason Blazzard: Wow. Wow, very cool, very cool. Yeah.
